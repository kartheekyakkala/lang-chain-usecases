# lang-chain-usecase


This project is actually a document-based chatbot that can answer questions and provide insights based on the content of the Bhagavad Gita, here I have used **"Bhagavad Gita As It Is" ** to finetune the model. This is only for research purpose.


This project uses the following resources:

- [Bhagavad Gita As It Is](https://ebooks.. foriskcondesiretree.com/pdf/00_-_Srila_Prabhupada/Bhagavad_Gita/Bhagavad_Gita_As_It_Is.pdf) by A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, ISKCON.


how to run the code:
  1. pip install -r requirements.txt
  1. add your openapi key to env file and run "streamlit run main.py"
